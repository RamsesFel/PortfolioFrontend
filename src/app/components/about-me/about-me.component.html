        <td><h1>My Story</h1></td>
        <td><h2>For as long as I can remember I have always wanted to work within the tech industry, specifically as a programer. During high school I was able to get my first hands on experience with coding by taking a computer science class which further motivated me to pursue a career in tech as it was easily my favorite class I took by far. In that class I learned that I was a very good fit for programming as I always enjoyed the process and I was very good at it to the point where the other students would often come to me for help instead of the teacher. After that class I decided that my dream job would be a software developer and tried everything I could to pursue that career. Unfortunately after high school I wasn't able to go to college for a multitude of reasons and had to immediately join the workforce and neglect my true passion for the time being. Recently I had an opportunity to try and pursue my dream career again by attending an online coding bootcamp at Grand Circus which gave me many of the skills and experiences needed to work as a software developer. As I continue practicing and learning more I am looking to take that first step into the tech industry in order to get that extremely valuable work experience I need in order to grow even further.</h2></td>

        <td><h1>Work Experience</h1></td>
        <td><h2>I've worked multiple different jobs from manual labor jobs at Amazon to customer service jobs at Meijer and more. While these jobs were more physical I did still gain some technical experience working with different programs by interacting with databases to manage inventory and using company software to solve problems and make certain tasks easier. However the most important thing my previous jobs have given me is the soft skills needed to succeed, for example the ability to manage time effectively, interact with customers and coworkers in a polite manner, the ability to problem solve under pressure and so much more.</h2></td>

        <td><h1>Education</h1></td>
        <td><h2>I wasn't able to obtain a traditional formal education so most of my education comes from my experiences and self teaching. After high school I immediately joined the work force which taught me a lot of soft skills until I was able to take a coding bootcamp which taught me many of the technical skills needed to feel confident enough to attempt to join the tech industry. My tech stack includes C#, Javascript, SQL, Angular, Git, HTML, CSS, Typescript, Bootstrap, JSON, MVC, OOP, API's, and more. I am still constantly pursuing education in my available freetime and am hoping to learn even more through work experience and any more education opportunities  I may come across in the future.</h2></td>

        <td><h2>When it comes to my freetime I usually prefer to stay home playing games or watching anime. I like to collect collectable like figures and old video game consoles while also decorating my room in the process. I am also a big fan of food and like trying to experiment and cook different recipes when I am able to. Though I haven't had many opportunities to I have many different places I would like to travel to when I get the chance to including places like Japan, Italy, Paris and many more. I of course also try to code in my freetime as well usually by either focusing on a specific topic I want to learn and doing small coding exercise on it or working on bigger projects that appeal to my interest.</h2></td>
